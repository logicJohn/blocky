# blockID

Ignore blocky2 it is my test subject muahahahahahaha


*** Thanks to Mellissa for making a kick-ass mascot for me :D ***

*** this requires hyperledger technology installed to view containers/cards ***


### BlockID powered by Blocky

## Inspiration

Over the past several years there has been an ongoing debate over where the lines of a users privacy start and stop in regards to governments, businesses and even the user themselves.  The power of the blockchain is the perfect application to create a decentralized network in which all users have equal power and benefits.

### The Problem
We live in a world where knowledge is power. Simply accessing the internet puts
the everyday consumer at the center of a marketing, advertising, and research
campaign to harvest their personal information for monetary gain. These
companies are in a position to take advantage of consumers by profiting off of the
information they have been trusted to keep private.

### The Solution
BlockID wants to separate the unknown from this equation. By creating a
blockchain consisting of regulators, consumers, and set contracts the consumer
can monetize on the distribution of their information from the comfort of your
couch. Companies and Auditors can quickly build secure portfolios of consumer
information that the individual can choose to sell in exchange for part of the
profits made from their identity.

## What it does
This project is broken down into primary service and a secondary web app for demonstration purposes.
Blocky (the primary service, powered by hyperledger)
  -a blockchain service to be implemented in order to create a blockchain that secures and monotizes user data
Enforce tech laws
## How I built it
I used Hyperledger composer, fabric, and playground for the backend and then used react for the front end services
## Challenges I ran into
I have no skills in front end application skills.... I am learning React now... pls pity me :D
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
it runs
## What I learned
I am not good at frontend (I think I knew this beforehand)
## What's next for blockID
 If people enjoy this blockchain idea even more than maybe I can submit it as an open GitHub project and get enough support that companies would like to use it.
